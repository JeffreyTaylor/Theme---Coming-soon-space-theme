		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>A) HTML Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This theme is a single page template. The intention of this template is to entice users to enter their e-mail, so that you can e-mail them later about updates to your new site!</p>

		<p>If you would like to edit the color, font or any elements on the screen, please open the <a href="src/css/style.css">src/css/style.css</a> file.</p>
    <p></p>


		<p>If you find that your new style is not overriding, it is most likely because of a specificity problem. Scroll down in your CSS file and make sure that there isn't a similar style that has more weight.</p>
		<p>So, to ensure that your new styles are applied, make sure that they carry enough "weight" and that there isn't a style lower in the CSS file that is being applied after yours.</p> 

		<hr>

		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>B) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>I'm only using one CSS file in this theme. This file contains general styling (such as anchor tag colors, font-sizes), as well as the css illustration of the astronaut and moon. At the very bottom of the file, you'll find the media queries necessary to detect and react to screen-size changes that may happen while this page is being displayed.</p>

    <p>The CSS file (<a href="src/css/style.css">src/css/style.css</a>) is broken up into the following sections</p>
<pre>	/* === Header Section === */

	some code

	/* === BACKGROUND === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === LOGO === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === CONTACT FORM === */
	
	some code

	/* === MOON === */

  some code

	/* === ASTRONAUT === */

  some code

  /* === MEDIA QUERIES === */
	
	etc, etc. 
</pre>
		
		<p>If you would like to edit a specific section of the site, simply find the appropriate label in the CSS file, and then scroll down until you find the appropriate style that needs to be edited.</p>
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>C) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This theme imports four Javascript files.</p>
		
		<ol>
      <li><a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://jqueryui.com/draggable/">jQuery-ui.draggable</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/">Particles.js</a></li>
      <li><a href="src/scripts/script.js">Custom scripts.js</a></li>
		</ol>
		  
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.</li>
      <li>jQuery.draggable is a Javascript library allows the user to drag things on the screen (the user is able to drag the astronaut around -- how fun!)</li>
      <li>Particles.js is the library used to draw and animate the background of the theme.</li>
      <li>Custom scripts.js is a custom file written exclusively for this theme. This contains the logic to set up the background as well as logic to validate & submit the subscribe form.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<hr>

		<p>Once again, thank you so much for purchasing this theme. As I said at the beginning, I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme. No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. If you have a more general question relating to the themes on ThemeForest, you might consider visiting the forums and asking your question in the "Item Discussion" section.</p>
